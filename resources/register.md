The *Global Project Database* (GProDB) is a part of the *JSONHub* project in its current development stage. 
The [jsonhub.cloud](https://jsonhub.cloud) service serves as a backend database for *GProDB* and also functions 
as an authentication server. This means that *JSONhub* provides all resource authorization and restrictions and that 
a user's access rights are determined by their [jsonhub.cloud](https://jsonhub.cloud) service subscription plan.
