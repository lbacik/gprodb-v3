*Global Project Database* (GProDB) is meant as a tool to help you find projects that are working on the same issues as you (or 
projects that may solve problems you faced, or projects that may appear interesting to you—you name it!).


> We highly value your input! The Global Project Database is a collaborative effort, constantly evolving 
with your feedback. Your suggestions and improvements are not just welcomed, they are crucial in enhancing your 
experience and shaping the platform.


## How it works

The database is a collection of projects accessible under the [Database]() tab. Each project has a page with 
a description, links, and a contact form to reach out to the project owner—purely informational stuff 
(nothing complicated here).


As a registered user, you have the power to add new projects to the database. If you decide to do so, the *GProDB* 
project comes with a little gift—you can quickly generate a **landing page** for your project containing (if you wish) 
**contact** and **newsletter** forms!
